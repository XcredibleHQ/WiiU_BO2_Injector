# WiiU_BO2_Injector
Black Ops II Wii U Injector

You need these file for the injector to work, i will update this repo a lot, like a LOT:

- final.txt
- injector.pyc
- tcpgecko.py
- common.py

You also need to install Python 2.7 and to install requests lib. "python -m pip install requests"

Note, this injector UI is bad becaus i've removed in the hurry a lot of fonctionality such as:

- Public Mod Injection (only works in private Match here)
- Wallhack
- End Game Non-Host
- DLC Class/Weapon/Camo/CallingCards

This injector has been published under GNU License, don't modify it and act like it is yours.

- NOTE: YOU NEED WJ444's TCP GECKO, OTHERWISE IT WONT WORK AS EXPECTED
